# Suggested usage:
#      from stdwinevents import *

# The function stdwin.getevent() returns a tuple containing:
#      (type, window, detail)
# where detail may be <no value> or a value depending on type, see below:

# Values for type:

WE_NULL       =  0     # not reported -- means 'no event' internally
WE_ACTIVATE   =  1     # detail is <no object>
WE_CHAR       =  2     # detail is the character
WE_COMMAND    =  3     # detail is one of the WC_* constants below
WE_MOUSE_DOWN =  4     # detail is ((h, v), clicks, button, mask)
WE_MOUSE_MOVE =  5     # ditto
WE_MOUSE_UP   =  6     # ditto
WE_MENU       =  7     # detail is (menu, item)
WE_SIZE       =  8     # detail is (width, height) [???]
WE_MOVE       =  9     # not reported -- reserved for future use
WE_DRAW       = 10     # detail is ((left, top), (right, bottom))
WE_TIMER      = 11     # detail is <no object>
WE_DEACTIVATE = 12     # detail is <no object>
WE_EXTERN     = 13     # detail is <no object>
WE_KEY        = 14     # detail is ???
WE_LOST_SEL   = 15     # detail is selection number
WE_CLOSE      = 16     # detail is <no object>

# Values for detail when type is WE_COMMAND:

WC_CLOSE      =  1     # user hit close box
WC_LEFT       =  2     # left arrow key
WC_RIGHT      =  3     # right arrow key
WC_UP         =  4     # up arrow key
WC_DOWN       =  5     # down arrow key
WC_CANCEL     =  6     # not reported -- turned into KeyboardInterrupt
WC_BACKSPACE  =  7     # backspace key
WC_TAB        =  8     # tab key
WC_RETURN     =  9     # return or enter key
