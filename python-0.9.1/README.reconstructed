The original posts were dated 21 Feb 1991 and titled:
   Python 0.9.1 part 01/21
      ...
   Python 0.9.1 part 21/21

although part 02 was retracted and is not needed. I also applied
the patch titled "Python 0.9 official patch #1" (22 Feb 1991).
I could not get patch to understand it so I applied the changes
manually.

My download from Google groups lost embedded tabs in the Makefile,
which I fixed by hand. My download also added a space at the end
of every line, so I wrote script to remove all trailing whitespace
before the newline.

Some of the code did not compile under gcc-4.0 on my Mac. These
are in the files import.c, listobject.c, and regexpmodule.c. I
added the right prototypes to make it work and put a comment
in the text. I also commented out the inclusion of the Python-
supplied implementation of strerror in the Makefile.

Some of the files may have extra or fewer blank lines than
the original source.

To compile, "cd src; make". The result is a "./python" in
that src directory.

Some quick differences from modern Python I found when
using the resulting binary:

  - classes must have the (), as in
      class Spam():
        pass

  - There is no '__init__' function for instances. The
      classes in the library by convention use 'Create()'
      and that must be explicitly called.

  - The library code does not consistently use 'self'.

  - Only single quote strings 'like this' are allowed. "Double quoted"
      strings are not allowed.

Enjoy!

Update from 26 October 2009:
Larry Hastings <larry@hastings.org> reports:
