This directory contains various demonstrations of what you can do with
Python.  The demos are grouped sub(sub*)directories according to
required optional built-in modules.

scripts                Some useful Python scripts that I put in my bin
               directory.  No optional built-in modules meeded.

sgi            Demos that only run on Silicon Graphics machines.
               Require the built-in modules 'audio' and/or 'gl'.

stdwin         Demos that use the STDWIN library.  Require the 'stdwin'
               built-in module.

WARNING: some scripts are executable and have a first line saying

       #! /ufs/guido/bin/sgi/python

This is unlikely to give good results anywhere else except in my
office.  Edit the first line before installing such scripts; to try
them out, you can just say "python file.py".  (The .py suffix is not
necessary in this case, but makes it possible to debug the modules
interactively by importing them.)
