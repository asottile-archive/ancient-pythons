Three programs that provide a user interface based upon STDWIN to the
audio device of the SGI 4D/25.  These scripts also demonstrate the power
of a set of window interface classes implemented in Python that simplify
the construction of all sorts of buttons, etc.

jukebox                Browses a directory full of sound samples and lets you
               play selected ones.  (Probably not fully functional, it
               requires a conversion program.)

rec            A tape recorder that lets you record a sound sample,
               play it back, and save it to a file.  Various options to
               set sampling rate, volume etc.  When idle it doubles
               as a VU meter.

vumeter                A VU meter that displays a history of the volume of
               sound recently sampled from the microphone.
