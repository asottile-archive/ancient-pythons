This directory contains demos that use the Panel Library by NASA Ames.
They only run on SGI machines and require the 'pnl' and 'gl' built-in
modules.  Each subdirectory contains one demo.

apanel         A trivial user interface to the audio capabilities of
               the 4D/25 (Personal IRIS).  Lets you record a sample and
               play it back at different volumes.  Requires the 'audio'
               built-in module.

flying         A large demonstration that can display several
               differently shaped objects through space.  Control
               panels let you manipulate light sources, material
               properties and drawing modes.

nurbs          A demo of the capabilities of the GL 'nurbs' functions
               that can display the control points.  (It was intended
               to let you move these as well, but there was a problem
               with the mapping of mouse movements in a 3-D world.)

twoview                A demo of GL's transformation primitives.  Two views on
               a scene are given, and the position and orientation of a
               viewer in one of the views can be changed through
               various buttons and dials in a control panel.
