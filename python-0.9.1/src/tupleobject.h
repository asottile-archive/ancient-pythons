Another generally useful object type is an tuple of object pointers.
This is a mutable type: the tuple items can be changed (but not their
number).  Out-of-range indices or non-tuple objects are ignored.

*** WARNING *** settupleitem does not increment the new item's reference
count, but does decrement the reference count of the item it replaces,
if not nil.  It does *decrement* the reference count if it is *not*
inserted in the tuple.  Similarly, gettupleitem does not increment the
returned item's reference count.
