Python 1.1 Extensions
=======================

This directory contains extension modules to Python.  You must already
have built and installed Python 1.1 (or possibly higher).  This
'Extensions' directory should be a direct subdirectory of Python's
toplevel directory (where the configure script lives).

Here's a list of available extensions; note that several are
unsupported or unfinished.  (Authors listed are for the extensions,
not for the software they interface to -- when not listed, I wrote it
myself.)  Each extension has its own README file:

X11 		Guess what?  (Works but still somewhat rough)
af		DEC CRL's AudioFile (probably incomplete)
amoeba		Free University's Amoeba distributed operating system
gsm		"GSM" audio encoding
jpeg		JPEG image compression, by Jack Jansen
metalbase	Metalbase database, by Lance Ellinghouse
mSQL		MiniSQL database, by Anthony Baxter
ptx		Pseudo TTYs, by Jaap Vermeulen (Sequent specific)
socks		SOCKS (socket interface through filewall), by Dan Connolly
suit		U of V's Simple UI Toolkit, by Bill Carlson & Matt Conway
wafe		WAFE (Tcl with X widgets), by Gustaf Neumann

Althoug theoretically each extension can have its own Makefile.pre.in,
in practice they all share exactly the same Makefile.pre.in file --
all dependencies on the module being built are in the Setup(.in) file.
For convenience, and in order to avoid having to update N copies each
time I add a feature to the generic Makefile.pre.in file, the
extension directories all contain a symbolic link to
../Makefile.pre.in.

Each extension does have its own Setup.in file, which is used in the
same manner as Modules/Setup.in in the main Python distribution (so
you never edit Setup.in -- you copy it to Setup and edit that).  The
configuration and build process is explained in detail in comments in
Makefile.pre.in.

There are also some examples that help you create your own extensions:

example		A simple example -- adds module 'xx'
example2	Adds module 'yy' to the previous example (i.e. adds 'xx', 'yy')
example3	Adds module 'zz' to example2 (i.e. adds 'xx', 'yy', and 'zz')
