This directory is a trivial example of how to set up a new extension.

Generally, Makefile.pre.in is the same for all extensions.  You edit
it only to point to the installed version of Python that you want to
use.  Everything that's dependent on the particular extension is in
the file Setup -- which has the same format (and is processed by the
same script) as the Modules/Setup file in the main Python
distribution.  Read that file (actually, Setup.in there) for detailed
instructions -- basically, you comment out lines for modules you don't
want and you edit the -I, -l and -L options and variable definitions
if necessary.

Detailed build instructions are in Makefile.pre.in.
